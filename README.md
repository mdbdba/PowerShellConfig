# PowerShellConfig
powershell script template for using a json config file

# Objective
Develop a powershell script that would:
  * be run locally on each environment's database server
  * have a single parameter that identifies the environment to work with.
  * use a json configuration file to drive the changes between environments.
  * compare the local server name to the one configured for the environment as a sanity check.

# PowerShell environment
powershell 4.0
